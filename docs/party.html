<p>It is a great pleasure to introduce our close friends and family joining us at the wedding party.</p>

<div class="party-separator">
    <h1 class="party-name">Catherine - Bridesmaid</h1>
    <img src="./content/images/catherine.jpg" />
    <p>
        I've known Catherine for seven years. We met at Microsoft working in the same department. 
        We are also neighbors. Because of how close we are, friendship started to develop upon sharing eggs, salt 
        and pepper when we run out, there are days when I come home to find lunch in front of my doorstep. 
        Besides food, we love watching and following soccer, the World Cup, and play musical instruments together.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="party-separator">
    <h1 class="party-name">Sophia - Bridesmaid</h1>
    <img src="./content/images/sophia.jpg" />
    <p>
        I've known Sophia for six years. We met each other through Catherine. We quickly became close friends after that.
        We love traveling, playing video games, and enjoy living together. Best memories are 
        when we were in Cancun. It was so fun and relaxing, we decided to go back to Cancun and repeated the same trip. 
        For some reason, we always got ourselves stuck in dangerous situations as if we didn't learn from the first trip.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="party-separator">
    <h1 class="party-name">Mary Ann - Bridesmaid</h1>
    <img src="./content/images/maryann.jpg" />
    <p>
        Mary Ann is the mother of two beautiful girls (Evalynn and Zola) and married to groomsman Zoran.
        She went to beauty school to become a cosmotologist and currently runs a hair salon.
        She is the youngest sibling in the family and is the sister of Peter and Ben Spada.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="party-separator">
    <h1 class="party-name">Anita - Bridesmaid</h1>
    <img src="./content/images/anita.jpg" />
    <p>
        Anita has been Peter's cousin since she was born. In recently uncovered home movies it was
        discovered that Peter taught Anita how to walk. Now she has three children (one girl and two boys)
        and still knows how to walk really well!
    </p>
</div>

<div class="party-separator">
    <h1 class="party-name">Ben - Groomsman</h1>
    <img src="./content/images/ben.jpg" />
    <p>
        My brother and I grew up doing everything together, being he's two years younger than me.
        We had the same best friends growing up, played video games, played sports, etc.
        When I'm visiting Michigan it's always great when he brings his son Anthony around to play.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="party-separator">
    <h1 class="party-name">Z - Groomsman</h1>
    <img src="./content/images/z.jpg" />
    <p>
        Zoran is my hockey playing brother-in-law. I stood up at his wedding when he married
        my sister, Mary Ann. Whenever I'm bored in Michigan I can go over their house to watch
        movies, or Z and I can go watch a Tigers game.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="party-separator">
    <h1 class="party-name">Dan - Groomsman</h1>
    <img src="./content/images/dan.jpg" />
    <p>
        Dan was one of my first friends right after moving to Redmond. His office was next door
        to mine at work and that continued to be the case for 13 years, despite many office moves.
        I think the managers just knew not to move us apart when assigning offices. Dan and I used
        to avoid celebrating Thanksgiving by going snowboarding in Canada. Those trips to
        Whistler were quite memorable.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="party-separator">
    <h1 class="party-name">Joe - Groomsman</h1>
    <img src="./content/images/joe.jpg" />
    <p>
        I've known Joe since since he was just a little baby intern at Microsoft. I've also had
        an office near Joe's at work for many many years. For all those years we've been on the
        same bowling team, competing against each other as well as the other team. I remember
        playing Rock Band with Joe and going through the "endlist setlist" which is a day-long
        exercise is playing fake instruments.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="party-separator">
    <h1 class="party-name">Tommy - Ring Bearer</h1>
    <img src="./content/images/tommy.jpg" />
    <p>
        This is Tommy, he is Lila's youngest nephew. 
        Tommy will be the ring bearer, that way we don't 
        have to worry where the rings are. 
        He is seven years old, he likes Power Rangers 
        and his favorite video game is Jet Pack Joyride.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="party-separator">
    <h1 class="party-name">Evalynn - Flower Girl</h1>
    <img src="./content/images/evalynn.jpg" />
    <p>
        Evalynn is Peter's three year old niece. She will be throwing flower petals around and she doesn't
        even have to pick them up. The ceremony guests will have to clean up afterwards... (just kidding)<br />
        Evalynn is a master Play-Doh artist, so if you want some stuck in your carpet, ask her to come over!
    </p>
</div>

<div class="party-separator">
    <h1 class="party-name">Saan - DJ</h1>
    <img src="./content/images/saan.jpg" />
    <p>
        Saan, our DJ and MC for the night. He wants two Ferraris and a Prius for commuting. 
        We ordered three hot wheels on Amazon with two day shipping.  
    </p>
</div>

<div class="party-separator">
    <h1 class="party-name">Phil - Officiator</h1>
    <img src="./content/images/phil.jpg" />
    <p>
        Phil will officiate the marriage with his one-day pass that gives him the power to
        declare anybody husband and wife. Will he use his power for good? Or for ultimate
        evil? We have to be nice to him.
